                The goal of this project was to learn about RabbitMQ, and use PostgresDB's native pub/sub to pass some events about. I also wanted to focus on proper error handling and code commenting.
                Feel free to check out the repos and give me some feedback! I'd welcome comments on my code. (Be gentle, I'm learning!)  <br><br>

                But, I wanted to teach myself a few things - specifically how to setup Webpack from scratch, how to use DocumentFragments to store pieces of HTML, and how to handle simple hash routing by listening to "popstate" events.

const Hero = `
I am a product & business strategist with experience working for large and small tech companies on three continents.<br><br>
I care about two things: finding product-market fit, and then achieving scale.<br><br>
I've tried to position myself at the interesction of tech, business, and design - equal parts tech nerd, sales jock and UX hipster.
Most of all, I enjoy turning data into executable narrative - breaking down complex problems into simple stories that drive a company towards product-market fit, and ultimately commercial success.`
